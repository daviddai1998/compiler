COMP 412, Fall 2015

This directory contains a set of tools to assist in Lab 3.

SchedAndRunALL -- takes each ILOC file in a directory, runs it
       through an instruction scheduler; runs the output of that
       scheduler through the simulator; and compares the results
       of the simulated execution against the original file's 
       OUTPUT spec.

       Syntax:
		SchedAndRunAll 

       Shell variables defined in "SchedAndRunAll" specify locations
       for the various tools and some of the paramters that they 
       use.

       The easiest way to use this script is to copy make a copy of 
       this directory. Change the definitions of the shell variables
       as needed (e.g., RUNALL in SchedAndRunALL and SCHED in 
       SchedHelper.  Copy SchedAndRunAll to your directory and then 
       execute it as 

       	    	./SchedAndRunAll 

       The scripts will use a temporary file in your home directory,
       named ~/SchedTest.log

NOTE:  The script "SchedHelper" uses the scheduler specified in its
       "SCHED" variable. You must change that variable to make it point
       to your own scheduler. Otherwise, it will invoke the reference
       implementation.
