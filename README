Command Syntax:
	./412alloc [flags] filename

Required arguments:

	-x   The –x flag will be used for Lab2CodeCheck1. When a –x flag is detected, 
		 412alloc must perform register renaming, not register allocation, 
		 on the input block contained in <file name>.
	k	 This command will be used to invoke register allocation for k registers 
		 on the input block contained in <file name>.
		 k is an integer that specifies the number of registers. 
		 For Lab 2, 3 ≤ k ≤ 64.
